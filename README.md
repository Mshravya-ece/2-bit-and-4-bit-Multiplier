2 bit Multiplier

This repository discusses the implementation of 2 bit and 4 bit multiplier in Cadence Virtuoso.

The 2 bit multiplier multiplies two 2 bit operands: B1 B0 and A1 A0 and yields a 4 bit output or product (P3 P2 P1 P0). The operation of a multiplier is shown below.

Pulse sources were applied at the input ports: B1 B0, A1 A0 and transient analysis was conducted and the below output was obtained.

The 2 bit multiplier consumed an average power of 344.3 uW and has a delay of 0.589 nanoseconds.

4 bit Multiplier

4 bit multiplier multiplies two 4 bit operands: B3 B2 B1 B0,A3 A2 A1 A0 and yields 8 bit output (P0 P1â€¦ P7). A 4 bit array multiplier can be designed using full adders and half adders as shown below.

Pulse sources are applied to the 8 input bits: B3 B2 B1 B0, A3 A2 A1 A0 in the testbench circuit.

The 4 bit array multiplier uses 2.441 mW power and has a delay of 0.96 nanoseconds.
